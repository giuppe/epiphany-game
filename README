Epiphany is a GPL'ed (free software) multi-platform clone of BoulderDash.
The player must collect all valuable minerals scattered in levels,
avoiding being hit by a falling boulder, or (worst :) by a bomb.


Current version: 0.6.0
Tested under Linux and Win32, on i386 systems;

It is a alpha version, but it is playable.
It uses SDL 1.2 and SDL_mixer 1.2 (http://www.libsdl.org), so make sure it is properly installed
before compiling Epiphany.

Read "Tech" file for informations about how to write new maps.

If you want to play contributed maps, just launch epiphany with the new map in the command line, e.g.:
epiphany ./mylevel.map

Keys:
Arrow keys -> move player;
Space bar -> snap (eat without move);
P or Pause -> pause game;
