Epiphany 0.5 Install:

*This is an alpha version. Use at your own risk ;)*

To compile, simply run 'make'.

If you want to store resources in a <path> different of that of executable,
you should change the RESOURCE_PATH variable in the makefile, and rebuild all.



There isn't, at the moment, any "make install":
you can manually copy the executable "epiphany" into /usr/local/bin;
sprites.scr, gfx/, sfx/ and maps/ should go into RESOURCE_PATH.


Epiphany needs ClanLib 0.6.x installed:
Go to http://www.clanlib.org

And it needs Directx on MS Windows systems.
